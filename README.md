## Symbol is built for developers

Symbol is a feature-rich development platform that lets you build blockchain projects faster and more efficiently, so you can exceed expectations.
Symbol uses familiar **APIs** so you can easily interface with your existing platform.
This means you can create a variety of architectural solutions with lightweight code efficiently, in **any programming language**.

Symbol provides access to both public and private blockchains, individually or as a hybrid, providing options to best suit your project's needs.
