But the Symbol Documentation has not been written from scratch. It draws a lot from previous NEM documents written by the community and core developers, adapted for this new release:

* `NEM Technical Reference <https://nemproject.github.io/nem-docs/pages/Whitepapers/NEM_techRef.pdf>`__
* `NEM Web Site <https://nem.io/>`__
* `NEM NIS API Reference <https://nemproject.github.io/>`__
* `NEM Knowledge base <https://nemproject.github.io/nem-docs>`__
* `NEM Developer guide by rb2nem <https://rb2nem.github.io/nem-dev-guide>`__
* `NEM Blog articles <https://nem.ghost.io/>`__
* `NEM Medium articles <https://medium.com/nemofficial>`__
