Contribute Documentation

There are several ways in which you can help the documentation effort, depending on how much involvement you want to have.

- Just passing by? :ref:`Make a casual suggestion <contribute-suggestion>`.
- Saw something not quite right? :ref:`Review the text <contribute-review>`.
- Would you like to see a page in your language? :ref:`Provide a translation <contribute-translation>`.
- Didn't find what you were looking for? :ref:`Write a new page <contribute-article>`.

Making suggestions
******************

You don't have to write anything if you don't want to. **Reporting mistakes or inaccurate information** is also very valuable!

At the bottom of every page (including this one) there is a link to `submit your feedback <https://github.com/symbol/symbol-docs/issues/new/choose>`__. This link will take you to **GitHub**'s issue reporting page. GitHub is the repository where all |codename| documentation is stored and you need to have an **account** to access it (creating one is easy and free).

Select whether you want to report an error or make a proposal:

.. figure:: /resources/images/screenshots/github-issue-type.png
   :align: center
   :class: with-shadow

It really does not matter much which one you choose, they are all called **issues** by GitHub.

Give your issue a **title**, write as much **detail** as you can about it, and click on ``Submit new issue``. That's all!
 
.. figure:: /resources/images/screenshots/github-new-issue.png
   :align: center
   :class: with-shadow

We will take care of properly labelling, categorizing and prioritizing the issue. There is nothing else you need to do, except maybe answer questions if there are any. You can go back to your issue at any time and follow its evolution.

.. _contribute-review:

Reviewing and Proofreading
**************************

There is also a mechanism in place in case you want to **edit a page directly** and **suggest your own text**, be it a sentence, a paragraph or a whole section.

At the top of the right column of every article (only visible on horizontal screens) there is a link to `Improve this page <https://github.com/symbol/symbol-docs/edit/main/source/contribute/contributing-docs.rst>`__. This link will open the article directly in the GitHub editor:

.. note:: Pages are written using `ReStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html>`__, an easy-to-read plain-text markup language. If you are not familiar with it, don't worry: Writing text and simple formatting is very easy.
