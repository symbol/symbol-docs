So glad you are visiting this section!

There are plenty of things you can do to help improve |codename|!

👩‍💻 Can you code?
*******************

|codename| is **Open Source**. Visit the |github| repositories and check if there is any project where you want to contribute.

There is the C++ `Catapult client <https://github.com/symbol/catapult-client>`__ but also Typescript tools like the `Wallets <https://github.com/symbol/desktop-wallet>`__, the `Explorer <https://github.com/symbol/symbol-explorer>`__, `Bootstrap <https://github.com/symbol/symbol-bootstrap>`__ and many more. Each repository's ``README`` and ``CONTRIBUTING`` files will tell you how to submit your code!

👨‍🏫 Can you write?
********************

This documentation is also **Open Source**, written by :doc:`many people <authors>` over the years. The :doc:`contributing-docs` page explains how you can improve it and help other |codename| users!

👨‍🎨 Can you draw?
*******************

Would you like to create the art used by the |codename| tools, sites or social media? **Share your samples** on |twitter| or |discord|!

👩‍🎤 Can you rally the masses?
*********************************

**Raise awareness** about the project using your **social media powers!** Symbol's main arena is |twitter|.

👨‍🔧 Can you host a node?
**************************

Do you know how to have a PC or :term:`VPS` plugged to the Internet and running 24h a day?

**Deploy a Symbol node!** You can receive :doc:`../concepts/harvesting` rewards even if you don't own a large quantity of ``XYM``, thanks to :ref:`delegated-harvesting`.

The :doc:`network guides <../guides/network/index>` explain how to create and maintain your own Symbol node.

🤔 Not sure what you can do?
**********************************

Here are some ideas:

- Just come hang out in the |discord| server, almost everything we do is public! Listen to discussions, participate, share your thoughts...
- Follow the development updates on |twitter|.

In short, **be part of the community**!
