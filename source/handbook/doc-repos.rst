There are currently 3 sources of documentation for Symbol. Feel free to jump to the one you are interested in.

- `Technical documentation <#technical-documentation>`__: Tool guides, developer tutorials, SDK reference guides and the Syndicate's handbook.
- `NEM NIS1 documentation <#nis1-documentation>`__: Old NEM NIS1 guides, pending assimilation into the Symbol technical docs.
- `Working documentation <#working-documentation>`__: Meeting minutes, Community logs, stuff that changes often.

Content
-------

This is the main technical reference for **Symbol**. It contains (or will contain):

- **User guides** for the different tools (Wallet, CLI, Explorer, etc.), intended for non-heavily-technical readers, including screenshots and step-by-step instructions on how to solve common problems.
- **Developer tutorials** with source code examples in different languages, organized by topics. Ranging from Getting Started to in-depth guides on specific topics.
- **Concept definitions** required to understand the Symbol protocol.
- **Technical reference** guides describing every API and REST endpoint.

Due to the complexity of the technical content, the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__ engine and `reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`__ is used instead of the simpler MarkDown format. This enables much more flexibility, so we can use multi-language (tabbed) code snippets, Python macros which automatically retrieve content from GitHub or have more formatting options for complex tables, for example.

Editing
-------

This repository follows the docs-as-code approach, meaning that you treat the documentation as if it was source code.

To contribute you need to check out the Git repository, make your changes and submit a `Pull Request <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests>`__ to GitHub. The repository maintainers will review your contribution, suggest changes if required and eventually merge it.

Testing locally
---------------

Before submitting a pull request it is a good idea to test your changes locally, to ensure that everything shows as expected and nothing breaks.

You first need to `Install Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html>`__. Basically, you need to:

- Install Python 3.7
- Run ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

After that you can trigger a build by running from the repository's root:

.. code-block:: bash

    make livehtml

This generates all HTML files in the ``build/html`` folder, including all assets like images, javascript, CSS, code snippets, etc. This also monitors your source folder and regenerates the output when changes are detected. It also instantiates a web server on ``localhost:8000`` for your convenience.

.. note::

    On Windows you have a handy ``make-win.bat`` that does the same thing but takes care of some Windows shenanigans like incorrect console output and filesystem monitoring.

Deployment
----------

The GitHub repository is linked to `Jenkins <https://jenkins.symboldev.com/job/Symbol/job/Docs/job/symbol-docs>`__, so on every push to the
``main`` branch a full build is triggered (See ``Jenkinsfile``). This involves several steps besides
the generation of the output documentation:

- **Source snippets validation**: The guides include lots of source code examples which are actually snippets from complete programs. These programs must **compile** and pass **lint checks** at all times and Travis makes sure of this. Right now only the TypeScript programs are checked.
- **Link checking**: All pages are examined to find broken links using ``make linkcheck``.

  Throttling is enabled to avoid pestering servers too much and getting ``HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`` errors. Still, sometimes your build fails because of this. If you detect such error in the Travis logs just try again.

  If you are sure a link is correct but linkcheck on Travis keeps failing, you can add this particular link to the ``linkcheck_ignore`` list in ``conf.py`` to skip checking it. Please add a comment explaining the reason.
- **Localization**: Text strings are extracted from every page using ``make gettext`` and uploaded to Transifex (see next section).
- **Publishing**: The built HTML pages are moved to the ``docs`` folder in the ``gh-pages`` branch and pushed. GitHub pages is configured to serve them from there.

Due to this process, pushes to ``main`` normally take up to 5 minutes to go live.

Localization
------------

Right now almost every page is available in Japanese besides the original English, but the repository is ready to accept more languages.

`Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/nemtech/symboldocs/>`__ is integrated in the deployment process, so after every push to ``main`` Travis extracts and sends all strings (``.pot`` files) to Transifex, which detects any new or updated text and notifies the translators.

Translators can log in to Transifex and provide the translations there. Developers can then download the updated text (``.po`` files) and commit them to the source repository.

So far this process has been entirely done by the Symbol community, even committing the updated texts and submitting pull requests.

Content
-------

These are the old NEM NIS1 docs, which were spread over several repos, blogs and forum posts, ported over a to single repository. This documentation is rather old and parts of it are still being figured out.

The old docs were mainly hosted at ``docs.nem.io`` from the `github.com/saulgray/nemioDev <https://github.com/saulgray/nemioDev>`__ repository using the `Grav Engine <https://getgrav.org/>`__.

A much simpler GitHub page is setup now, using the `Jekyll Engine <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll>`__ provided by GitHub, using plain Markdown. All content is in the ``gh-pages`` branch.

.. note:: There is still some placeholders left in the docs (like `the overview page <https://nemproject.github.io/nem-docs/pages/Overview/docs.en.html>`__) so a big **PREVIEW** banner is shown at the top of every page.

    This banner is `hardcoded in the layout HTML file <https://github.com/NemProject/nem-docs/blob/gh-pages/_layouts/default.html#L45>`__ and can be removed once the docs are good to go public.

Editing
-------

This repository follows the docs-as-code approach, meaning that you treat the documentation as if it was source code.

To contribute you need to check out the Git repository, make your changes and submit a `Pull Request <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests>`__ to GitHub. The repository maintainers will review your contribution, suggest changes if required and eventually merge it.

Testing locally
---------------

Before submitting a pull request it is a good idea to test your changes locally, to ensure that everything shows as expected and nothing breaks.

Follow `GitHub's instructions <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll>`__ to install a local Jekyll instance and run it.

Deployment
----------

Deployment is straightforward since a standard GitHub pages setup is used (GitHub repo + Jekyll site + GitHub pages). Just push to the ``gh-pages`` branch and it will be published in seconds.

This is meant as a scratch pad for collaborative editing, or as a means of storage for documents that change too often or are too big or numerous to be in the Handbook.

Examples are:

- Documents being worked on (they are live, or waiting approval to go into the Handbook)
- Meeting minutes (there are too many of them)
- Test results (they change continuously)

To keep this area organized all documents should be **tagged**. Please add this line at the bottom of your document:

.. code-block::

   ###### tags: `tag1` `tag2`

Use any tag you want, but please look at the other documents and try to be consistent.

.. caution:: If you don't use a tag your document will appear in the **Untagged** section and you will be severely reprimanded.
