**********************
The Smart Asset System
**********************

|nem| is a developer-friendly blockchain platform. Rather than force you to write your own “smart contract” code from scratch, NEM gives you direct access to a specialized set of tested and secure on-blockchain :doc:`features <../concepts/account>`.

NEM is suitable for an amazing variety of solutions of different classes, such as direct public transactions via a streamlined smartphone app, efficient cloud services that connect client or web applications, or a high-performance permissioned enterprise back-end for business-critical record keeping.

    The Smart Asset System

*******************
Architecting on NEM
*******************

NEM :doc:`nodes <../concepts/node>` provide a powerful, stable and secure platform where smart asset transactions are conducted, searched, and immutably logged to the blockchain ledger.

All the features are available through the API interface on each node in the network itself. This means that the blockchain can be used to create a variety of architecture solutions with lightweight :doc:`code in any language <../sdk/languages>`.

NEM provides both a decentralized, open and self-sustaining **public blockchain** that can be used by anyone – as well as a **permissioned/private blockchain solution** that can be provisioned specifically for your use on your servers when speed and privacy are the priority.
