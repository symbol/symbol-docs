How to use your Ledger device with Symbol Wallet
################################################

The Ledger Nano S and X are hardware wallets that support multiple cryptocurrencies, including Symbol.

A hardware wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet where you can store your private keys on a physical device. It's a secure and simultaneously user-friendly way to access your coins, as the private key is stored on the device and doesn't get leaked. Your coins are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.

Symbol Wallet for Desktop allows you to send and receive Symbol assets using a Ledger hardware wallet. Along with providing support for XYM, the Ledger device can also offer support for tokens created on the Symbol blockchain.
