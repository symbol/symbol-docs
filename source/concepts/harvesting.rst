Harvesting
##########

The process of creating new :doc:`blocks <block>` is called harvesting.

In this process, the :doc:`account <account>` that harvests a block — called the **harvester** — is rewarded with the transaction :ref:`fees <fees>` added in the block and the :doc:`inflation <inflation>` tokens generated, if applicable.

Once an account harvests a block, the block recorded stores in its :ref:`header <block-header>` the public key and signature generated by the harvesting account.

********************
Eligibility criteria
********************

The :ref:`importance score <importance-calculation>` determines the probability of an account to harvest the next block in case the account has harvesting turned on and all other accounts are harvesting too.

An account needs to hold a :properties:`minimum amount <config-network.properties>` of :ref:`harvesting mosaics <harvesting-mosaic>` to have importance greater than zero. Eligible accounts can use their importance scores to create new blocks either by :ref:`running a node <local-harvesting>` or delegating it to a :ref:`remote node <delegated-harvesting>`.

.. _harvesting-mosaic:

*****************
Harvesting mosaic
*****************

Catapult software allows the :properties:`definition <config-network.properties>` of any :doc:`mosaic <mosaic>` for harvesting purposes to fit the business needs. The catapult test network names this mosaic ``cat.harvest``.

For example, consortium networks can distribute harvesting mosaics between the companies that are running the infrastructure, while other participants need to pay fees in the form of :ref:`currency mosaic <fees>` to consume services.

By contrast, public networks might decide to use the same mosaic for paying transaction fees and running the network.

.. _local-harvesting:

****************
Local harvesting
****************

An eligible account can harvest new blocks by running a node. To harvest locally, provide the private key in :properties:`config-harvesting.properties <config-harvesting.properties>` file.

Besides, each node can set a **beneficiary public key** to share a percentage of the harvesting rewards (:ref:`fees <fees>` and :doc:`inflation <inflation>`), being the sharing ratio configurable for each network. When the node does not define a beneficiary, all the rewards go to the block signer.

Local harvesting is secure as long as no one accesses your node instance, which is storing the private key.

.. _delegated-harvesting:

********************
Delegated harvesting
********************

An eligible account may also delegate its importance score to a :ref:`remote node <delegated-harvesting>` for harvesting.

Delegated harvesting enables an account to use a **proxy private key** that can be shared with a node securely. In other words, you can use the importance score of your account to create new blocks without running a node.

        end

To enable delegated harvesting, the account owner has to link its **importance score** to a remote account announcing an :ref:`AccountLinkTransaction <account-link-transaction>`.

Then, the account needs to send a **special encrypted message** to the node via a :doc:`TransferTransaction <transfer-transaction>`. The message must contain the remote's account **proxy private key**  encrypted using AES, so that only the recipient will be able to decipher it.

The node receives an encrypted message using :ref:`WebSockets <websockets>`. Once the node decrypts the private key of the potential delegated harvester, the node owner can **add the remote account as a delegated harvester** if the candidate meets the requirements.

As the remote private key is **saved on disk**, even if the node disconnects temporarily, the persistent delegated harvesters will be reestablished once the node reconnects to the network. Additionally, the use of encrypted message creates a **backup** of the information for the nodes. If the disk containing the delegated keys becomes corrupted or destroyed, the node owner can retrieve the data by querying the blockchain.

Security-wise, **sharing a proxy private key** does not compromise the original account since:

* The remote account has zero balance.
* The remote account by itself can't transfer the importance to another account.
* The original account receives the resulting fees.

Remote harvesters may not receive the entire reward if the following conditions are met:

*  The network harvesting sharing rate is greater than 0.
*  The node selected has defined a :ref:`beneficiary account <local-harvesting>`.

.. _account-link-transaction:

AccountLinkTransaction
======================

Announce an AccountLinkTransaction to delegate the account importance to a remote account.

In order for the remote account to be accepted for delegated harvesting, it needs to meet the following conditions:

* It cannot own any mosaics.
* It cannot be a cosignatory of any other account.
* It cannot be a multisig account.
* It cannot already be a remote account for another account.
* It cannot be its own remote account.

Furthermore, for the duration that the account is used as a delegated account, it is restricted from:

* initiating any transactions.
* involvement with any type of transactions.

**Entity type**: 0x414C

**Inlines**:
