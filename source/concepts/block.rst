Block
#####

The central element of every cryptocurrency is a public ledger called the **blockchain**, which links blocks together.

Since the blocks in the chain are ordered, the complete :doc:`transaction <transaction>` history is held on the blockchain.
Subsequent blocks have increasing heights that differ by one.
Each block can contain up to ``1,000`` transactions (public network), being this value :ref:`configurable per network <config-network-properties>`.

Blocks are stored in a database as permanent medium.
|codename| calls the first block in the chain the **nemesis block**.

|codename| blocks complete every ``15`` seconds, making transactions confirm quickly enough for everyday use.

**************
Block creation
**************

Blocks are created by :doc:`accounts <account>`.
The process of creating new blocks is called :doc:`harvesting <harvesting>`.
The **harvesting account**—called the harvester— gets the :doc:`fees <fees>` for the transactions in the block and :doc:`inflation <inflation>`. This gives the harvester an incentive to add as many transactions to the block as possible.

Block header

Serialization of the block header.

**Inlines:**

* :ref:`SizePrefixedEntity <size-prefixed-entity>`
