Block
#####

The central element of every cryptocurrency is a public ledger called the **blockchain**, which links blocks together.

Since the blocks in the chain are ordered, the complete :doc:`transaction <transaction>` history is held on the blockchain.
Subsequent blocks have increasing heights that differ by one.
Each block can contain up to ``1,000`` transactions (public network), being this value :ref:`configurable per network <config-network-properties>`.

|codename| blocks complete every ``15`` seconds, making transactions confirm quickly enough for everyday use.

Nodes stores blocks in a serialized form as follows:

**Inlines:**

* :ref:`SizePrefixedEntity <size-prefixed-entity>`
* :ref:`VerifiableEntity <verifiable-entity>`
* :ref:`EntityBody <entity-body>`

    height; :schema:`Height <types.cats#L5>`; Height of the blockchain. Each block has a unique height. Subsequent blocks differ in height by 1.
    timestamp; :schema:`Timestamp <types.cats#L8>`; Number of milliseconds elapsed since the creation of the nemesis block.
    difficulty; :schema:`Difficulty <types.cats#L4>`; Determines how difficult is to find a new block, based on previous blocks.
    previousBlockHash; :schema:`Hash256 <types.cats#L12>`; Hash of the previous block.
    transactionsHash; :schema:`Hash256 <types.cats#L12>`; Hash of the transactions in this block.
    receiptsHash; :schema:`Hash256 <types.cats#L12>`;  Hash of the receipts generated by this block.
    stateHash; :schema:`Hash256 <types.cats#L12>`;   Hash of the global chain state at this block.
    beneficiaryPublicKey; :schema:`Key <types.cats#L14>`; Public key of the optional beneficiary designated by harvester.
    feeMultiplier; :schema:`BlockFeeMultiplier <types.cats#L3>` ; Fee multiplier applied to block transactions.
    blockHeader_Reserved1; uint32; Reserved padding to align end of BlockHeader on 8-byte boundary.

********
Creation
********

|codename| calls the first block in the chain the **nemesis block**.
The first block is defined before launching a new network and sets the distribution of the network currency mosaics.

The process of creating the subsequent new blocks is called :doc:`harvesting <harvesting>`.

Blocks are created by :doc:`accounts <account>` based on their importance score.
The :doc:`consensus algorithm <consensus-algorithm>` chooses each round the account that harvest the block. 

The harvesting account receives the :doc:`fees <fees>` for the transactions added in the block and the mosaics created by :doc:`inflation <inflation>`.
This gives the harvester an incentive to add as many transactions to the block as possible.

.. _rollbacks:

*********
Rollbacks
*********

Blockchains are designed in a way that, in the presence of a network failure or partition, the recent blocks might need to be rolled back.

The rewrite limit is the maximum number of blocks that can be rolled back.
Hence, forks can only be resolved up to a certain depth too.

|codename|'s public network has a rewrite limit of ``398`` blocks, being this limit :ref:`configurable per network <config-network-properties>`.
At this point, the transactions linked to the block are permanently recorded on the blockchain.
