Block
#####

The central element of every cryptocurrency is a public ledger called the **blockchain**, which links blocks together.

.. Each Catapult block can contain up to ``N`` :doc:`transactions <transaction>`.

Since the blocks in the chain are ordered, the complete **transaction history** is held on the blockchain. Subsequent blocks have increasing heights that differ by one.

Blocks are stored in a database as permanent medium. Catapult calls the first block in the chain the **nemesis block**.

Catapult blocks complete every ``15`` seconds, making transactions confirm quickly enough for everyday use.

**************
Block creation
**************

Blocks are created by :doc:`accounts <account>`. The process of creating new blocks is called :doc:`harvesting <harvesting>`. The **harvesting account**—called the harvester— gets the :doc:`fees <fees>` for the transactions in the block and :doc:`inflation <inflation>`. This gives the harvester an incentive to add as many transactions to the block as possible.

Serialization of the block header.

    height; :schema:`Height <types.cats#L5>`; Height of the blockchain. Each block has a unique height. Subsequent blocks differ in height by 1.
    timestamp; :schema:`Timestamp <types.cats#L5>`; Number of milliseconds elapsed since the creation of the nemesis block.
    difficulty; :schema:`Difficulty <types.cats#L4>`; Average difficulty divided by the average block creation time for the last ``60`` blocks. If the new difficulty is more than 5% greater or smaller than the difficulty of the last block, then the change is capped to 5%. Additionally, difficulties are kept within certain bounds. The new difficulty is clamped to the boundaries if it is greater than 10\ :sup:`15` or smaller than 10\ :sup:`13`\ .
    previousBlockHash; :schema:`Hash256 <types.cats#L12>`; Hash of the previous block.
    transactionsHash; :schema:`Hash256 <types.cats#L12>`; Hash of the transactions in this block.
    receiptsHash; :schema:`Hash256 <types.cats#L12>`;  Hash of the receipts generated by this block.
    stateHash; :schema:`Hash256 <types.cats#L12>`;   Hash of the global chain state at this block.
    beneficiaryPublicKey; :schema:`Key <types.cats#L14>`; Public key of the optional beneficiary designated by harvester.
    feeMultiplier; :schema:`BlockFeeMultiplier <types.cats#L3>` ; Fee multiplier applied to block transactions.
    blockHeader_Reserved1; uint32; Reserved padding to align end of BlockHeader on 8-byte boundary.
